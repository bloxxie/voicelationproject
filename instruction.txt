## Language Models

The script uses local Vosk language models for transcription. It expects the following models to be present in the same directory:

*   **English Model:** `vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15`
*   **Filipino Model:** `vosk-model-tl-ph-generic-0.6`

If the models are not found locally, the script will attempt to download them automatically. You can also download them manually from the Vosk website and place them in the correct folders.

Vosk models are available at: https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
